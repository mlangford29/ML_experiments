# ML_experiments

Welcome! This is my repository of personal machine learning experiments for me to gain knowledge in a wide range of data science techniques. This is also my space to learn more about different libraries and frameworks to incorporate in my workflow.

If you're curious about how I approach modeling problems, feel free to check out the notebook in lung_cancer_survival_analysis, as I previously performed this analysis for a case study.
